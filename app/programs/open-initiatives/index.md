title: Support of Open Initiatives

---

The OSC strongly supports open scholarship at Harvard, even when it isn't directly related to a Harvard Open Access Policy. Examples of such initiatives include:

- [Harvard Library Open Metadata](http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/)
- the [Harvard Library Policy on Access to Digital Reproductions of Works in the Public Domain]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/open-initiatives/hl-pd/)
- the [Harvard University Herbaria Policy on Access to Digital Reproductions of Works in the Public Domain]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/open-initiatives/huh-pd/)
- the [Open Data Assistance Program](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/odap), a [collaboration](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/news/iqss-collaborates-osp-launch-open-data-assistance-program) between [IQSS](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/) and OSC
