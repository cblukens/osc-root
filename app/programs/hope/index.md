The Harvard Open-Access Publishing Equity (HOPE) fund provides funds for the reimbursement of reasonable article processing fees for articles authored or co-authored by Harvard researchers published in [eligible open-access journals]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/hope/faq/#eligible-venues) for which no alternative funding is available.

Members of the Harvard Community can apply for HOPE funds by completing a [webform](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/hope/).

The HOPE fund is Harvard's implementation of the [Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity](http://www.oacompact.org/).
