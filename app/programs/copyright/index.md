## Mission

The mission of this service is to establish a culture of shared understanding of copyright among Harvard faculty, students, and staff in support of pedagogy, research, and innovation.

## About

Copyright First Responders support the work of the University by providing services that help advance teaching, learning, and scholarship through community engagement with copyright. Embedded in each library, archive, or department, Copyright First Responders will develop information expertise, create a collaborative network of support among their peers involved with copyright issues, both locally and across the library, and serve as a resource for the Harvard community by answering copyright questions and sharing critical knowledge.
