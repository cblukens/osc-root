The OSC supports open access outside Harvard with [public statements]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/advocacy/statements/), as well as participation in programs like [COPE](http://www.oacompact.org/) and [Open Access Week](http://www.openaccessweek.org/).

## Other Institutions
Considering an Open Access policy at your institution? Curious how Harvard does things? The OSC and the [Harvard Open Access Project](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Main_Page) (HOAP) are available to help. HOAP has a large collection of [resources](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Main_Page#Project_pages); in addition, see

- [The Harvard-Model Open Access Policy]({{site.baseurl}}/modelpolicy/)
- [A Sample Waiver]({{site.baseurl}}/sample_waiver/)
- [A Sample Addendum]({{site.baseurl}}/sample_addendum/)
