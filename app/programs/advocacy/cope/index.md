COPE, The Compact for Open-access Publishing Equity, supports equity of the business models by committing each university to “the timely establishment of durable mechanisms for underwriting reasonable publication charges for articles written by its faculty and published in fee-based open-access journals and for which other institutions would not be expected to provide funds.”

On September 14, 2009, Harvard joined Cornell, Dartmouth, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of California, Berkeley, in formalizing a commitment to open-access publication.

Universities subsidize the costs of subscription journals by subscribing to them. Universities and funding agencies can provide equitable support for the processing-fee business model for open-access journals — to place the subscription-fee and processing-fee models on a more level playing field — by subsidizing processing fees as well.

The Harvard Open-Access Publishing Equity (HOPE) fund is Harvard’s implementation of the Compact. HOPE provides funds to Harvard authors to reimburse processing fees for articles published in open-access journals.
