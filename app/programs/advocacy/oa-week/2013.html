    <h3 id="orcid">Register for an <a href="http://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID</a> to identify your&nbsp;scholarship.&nbsp;</h3>
    <p><a href="https://orcid.org/register" target="_blank">Registration</a>&nbsp;is quick, and once you have an ORCID you can unambiguously identify yourself with your work across disciplines and other identifying systems&nbsp;globally.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In May 2013, Harvard became an institutional&nbsp;<a href="http://lib.harvard.edu/harvard-adopt-service-uniquely-identify-academic-authors" target="_blank">supporter</a> of&nbsp;<a href="http://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID</a>, "an open, non-profit, community-based effort to provide a registry of unique researcher identifiers and a transparent method of linking research activities and outputs to these&nbsp;identifiers."</p>
    <p>Because the theme of this year's Open Access Week is "Redefining Impact," the OSC would like to encourage Harvard authors to distinguish themselves with this unique&nbsp;identifier.&nbsp;</p>

    <h3 id="dash">Explore Harvard's DASH</h3>
    <p>Read an article from <a href="http://dash.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">DASH</a>, explore our&nbsp;<a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/stories" target="_blank">user stories</a>, and write a <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/features" target="_blank">highlight</a>.</p>
    <p>The OSC is also pleased to announce that Harvard's open access repository,&nbsp;<a href="http://dash.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard</a>&nbsp;(DASH), has reached an impressive milestone: the over 13,000 articles in DASH, which include work from almost 2,800 faculty across the disciplines in the eight schools with policies, have been downloaded over 2 million times&nbsp;globally.</p>
    <p>Open access to this wealth of research has had a demonstrable impact on the diverse cross section of DASH users. Scholars and students, researchers and journalists, doctors and nurses, and social workers and parents from the world over have shared stories of how access to Harvard scholarship has touched their&nbsp;lives.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Samples of these user stories are posted across campus this week, and may also be found&nbsp;<a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/stories" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The OSC thanks the University community for participating in DASH and looks forward to continuing this effort of opening Harvard's&nbsp;research.</p>
    <p>To celebrate having crossed this threshold, the OSC would also like to welcome the community to select work from DASH to highlight in the&nbsp;<a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/features" target="_blank">DASH features section</a>. If there is faculty, student, or staff work that you would like to showcase, then please <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/contact" target="_blank">contact</a> the OSC for more&nbsp;details.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Harvard has been, and continues to be, a leader in the open access&nbsp;movement.</p>
<p>Since the unanimous vote by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) to implement a school-wide&nbsp;<a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies" target="_blank">Open Access Policy</a>&nbsp;in February 2008, seven other Harvard schools - the Graduate School of Education, the Graduate School of Design, the Business School, the Law School, the Kennedy School of Government, the Divinity School, and, in November 2012, the School of Public Health - have adopted open access policies. The FAS policy was the first of its kind in the United States, and has served as a model for other&nbsp;institutions.</p>
<p>Harvard is dedicated to sharing its resources in other ways. Of note is the&nbsp;<a href="http://openmetadata.lib.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">opening</a>&nbsp;of more than twelve million Harvard Library catalog records in April 2012, and advocacy efforts on the national policy level. Harvard continues to champion the open distribution of scholarly knowledge both within and outside its&nbsp;gates.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">To this end, Harvard affiliates have developed and distributed the following resources, which provide information on the open access movement, open access policies, and open access&nbsp;journals:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">In June 2012, Peter Suber published&nbsp;<em><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Open_Access_(the_book)" target="_blank">Open Access</a></em>. This book became openly available in June 2013, and during this year's Open Access Week, Peter&nbsp;Suber&nbsp;<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/open-access-week-ii" target="_blank">wrote</a>&nbsp;a guest post on the evolution of the book for the MIT Press&nbsp;blog.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">In 2011, Stuart Shieber, the OSC's faculty director, and Peter Suber developed the "<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies" target="_blank">Good practices guide for open access policies</a>." On October 23rd, the Berkman Center for Internet <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Society <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/8604" target="_blank">released</a> the first print and PDF editions of this&nbsp;guide.</p>
<p class="p1">Last, a collaboration between the Harvard Open Access Project (HOAP) and Open Access Society Publishers Association (OASPA) catalogs and maps open access journals from society publishers. An October 21st <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PeterSuber/posts/NwZPXLY4CeQ" target="_blank">announcement</a> by Peter Suber describes what is now the third edition of this&nbsp;project.</p>
