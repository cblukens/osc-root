  <h3>Open Access Week Reading List</h3>
  <p>Peter Suber, Director of the Harvard Library Office for Scholarly Communication, put together an <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PeterSuber/posts/4RetrjzvbwY">Open Access Week reading list</a>.  Says Suber: </p>
  <blockquote>I hope you talk about OA at every opportune moment. If an opportune moment doesn't come up every week, then use OA Week as the occasion. In my view, that's the main purpose of OA Week. Talk from a stage, your office, a hallway, a sidewalk, or a café table… If you inspire your colleagues to want to act or learn more, then follow up with some suggested readings. Here are <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PeterSuber/posts/4RetrjzvbwY">half a dozen of my own that I can recommend</a>.</blockquote>

  <h3>Stories from DASH Readers</h3>
  <p>Visit the OSC page <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/stories">Your Story Matters</a>. Every year, hundreds of user stories arrive at the Office for Scholarly Communication (OSC). Global scholars in every discipline take a moment to react to or comment on work they have downloaded from DASH, Harvard's open-access repository. Most of these user stories thank the OSC, Harvard Library, and Harvard University faculty, students, and academics for making vital research and scholarship freely available to them and their peers. Many present moving and detailed narratives about personal enrichment, community engagement, and challenges with censorship or access restrictions.</p>
