As a faculty assistant, you have a key role in the implementation of Harvard's [open access policies]({{site.baseurl}}/policies/). Your main task is likely to be submitting scholarly work to [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu/), Harvard's open-access repository, using our [quick submit form]({{site.baseurl}}/dash/quicksubmit). You may also help the OSC deposit work in DASH by providing your faculty member's CV; our Open Access Fellows would then "scrape" the CV for citations and submit them to DASH. In cases where we don't have the preferred version of an article, the accepted manuscript, we may ask you to help locate a copy.

(Before articles can appear in DASH, OSC must have on file an [Assistance Authorization]({{site.baseurl}}/dash/proxy/webform)&mdash;we may ask for your help in getting your faculty member to submit it.)

You may also assist with the publication process; the [author addendum]({{site.baseurl}}/dash/addendum-generator) is a way to make a publishing contract consistent with the open-access policy, and some publishers require authors to get a [waiver]({{site.baseur}}/dash/authors/waiver/generate) of Harvard's license under the policy.
