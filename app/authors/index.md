The OSC provides information and support for Harvard faculty and affiliates as they make decisions regarding their scholarly works. We offer a wide variety of services: you can [put your work]({{site.baseurl}}/dash/quicksubmit) in [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu), or we can do it for you&mdash;we'll scrape your CV and our Open Access Fellows will submit your articles. You'll really love the [stats]({{site.baseurl}}/dash/mydash/) you get each month. Need reasons? Check out our [stories]({{site.baseurl}}/dash/stories) page. Further:

- Our [Open Access Policy guidelines](#) are designed to help authors understand how the Open Access Policy affects them.

- Publishers’ agreements concerning publication of articles often contain provisions that are inconsistent with the prior license granted to Harvard under the Open Access Policy. An [author addendum]({{site.baseurl}}/dash/addendum-generator), however, is a simple legal tool that can resolve the conflict.

- Several publishers have formally agreed to recognize Harvard’s rights under the Open Access Policy. We are grateful to [these publishers]({{site.baseurl}}/publishers/treaties/) for their full support of access to Harvard faculty’s writings.

- Through the [HOPE program]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/hope/), Harvard researchers can apply for funds for the reimbursement of reasonable article processing fees in eligible open-access journals for which no alternative funding is available.

- Harvard authors subject to the Open Access Policy may request a [waiver]({{site.baseurl}}/dash/authors/waiver/generate) of Harvard’s nonexclusive license on an article-by-article basis.
