The OSC supports all Harvard faculty and affiliates as you publish your research and make decisions regarding your scholarly works. 

We offer a wide variety of services: open your scholarship to the world by [depositing your work](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/quicksubmit) in [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu), or [ask the OSC](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=Request for assistance with DASH) and we can do it for you&mdash;we'll study your CV and do the legal legwork, and our Open Access Fellows will submit your articles. You'll love the [statistics](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/mydash/) you receive each month about who is reading your scholarship&mdash;and so will your tenure committee. You'll enjoy [increased citation rates](http://www.openoasis.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=560&Itemid=391), Google optimization, and a number of other benefits. Read how DASH scholarship helps people all over the world by browsing our [user stories](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/stories). Further:

- Our [Open Access Policy FAQ]({{site.baseurl}}/policies/faq/) and [Author FAQ]({{site.baseurl}}/authors/faq/) are designed to help authors understand how the Open Access Policy affects them.

- Through the [HOPE program]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/hope/), Harvard researchers can apply for funds for the reimbursement of reasonable article processing fees in eligible open-access journals for which no alternative funding is available.

- Publishers’ agreements concerning publication of articles often contain provisions that are inconsistent with the prior license granted to Harvard under the Open Access Policy. An [author addendum]({{site.baseurl}}/dash/addendum-generator), however, is a simple legal tool that can resolve the conflict.

- Harvard authors subject to the Open Access Policy may request a [waiver]({{site.baseurl}}/dash/authors/waiver/generate) of Harvard’s nonexclusive license on an article-by-article basis.

- Several publishers have formally agreed to recognize Harvard’s rights under the Open Access Policy. We are grateful to [these publishers]({{site.baseurl}}/publishers/treaties/) for their full support of access to Harvard faculty’s writings.
