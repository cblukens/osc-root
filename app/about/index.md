The Office for Scholarly Communication was formed in 2008 with a charge to the [University Library](http://library.harvard.edu/) from the [Harvard Provost](http://www.provost.harvard.edu/) to spearhead campus-wide initiatives to open, share, and preserve scholarship.

The OSC, part of Harvard Library's [Collections](http://hcl.harvard.edu/collections/), benefits from the oversight of a University-wide [faculty advisory committee]({{site.baseurl}}/about/committee) that provides advice on specific programs and policies.
 
With support from OSC, [open-access policies]({{site.baseurl}}/policies) are now in place at all nine Harvard schools. These policies were voted on by the faculty and grant an automatic license to Harvard for scholarly articles authored by faculty members. OA policies have also been voted at three University research centers.

OSC runs [Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard (DASH)](http://dash.harvard.edu/), the University-wide, open-access repository used to house articles that fall under the faculty OA policies.

OSC is undertaking other activities related to open access:

## ETDs @ Harvard

In partnership with individual schools, OSC has developed [ETDs @ Harvard](http://etds.lib.harvard.edu/about.html), a submission tool for electronic theses and dissertations. The system, based on Texas Digital Libraries' Vireo, includes workflows for depositing theses in DASH, the library catalog, and Harvard's digital preservation repository.

## Copyright

The [Harvard Library Copyright Advisor]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/copyright/) program was established in 2014. In addition to responding directly to questions from around the university, Copyright Advisor Kyle Courtney has trained thirty librarians as [Copyright First Responders]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/copyright/first-responders/).

## Other projects

Other OSC projects include

- a study of [flipping journals]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/journal-flipping/) to open access
- an effort to identify no-risk or low-risk strategies for digitizing [orphan works]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/orphan-works/) for open access
