The Office for Scholarly Communication was formed in 2008 with a charge to the [University Library](http://library.harvard.edu/) from the [Harvard Provost](http://www.provost.harvard.edu/) to spearhead campus-wide initiatives to open, share, and preserve scholarship.

The OSC, part of Harvard Library's [Collections](http://hcl.harvard.edu/collections/), benefits from the oversight of a University-wide [faculty advisory committee]({{site.baseurl}}/about/committee) that provides advice on specific programs and policies.
