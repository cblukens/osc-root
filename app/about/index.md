The Office for Scholarly Communication was formed in 2008 with a charge to the [University Library](http://hul.harvard.edu/) from the [Harvard Provost](http://www.provost.harvard.edu/) to spearhead campus-wide initiatives to open, share, and preserve scholarship.

The OSC benefits from the oversight of a University-wide [faculty advisory committee](/about/committee) that provides advice on specific programs and policies.
 
With support from OSC, [open-access policies]({{site.baseurl}}/policies) are now in place in all nine Harvard schools. These policies were voted on by the faculty and grant an automatic license to Harvard for scholarly articles authored by faculty members.

[Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard (DASH)](http://dash.harvard.edu/) is the University-wide, open access repository used to house articles that fall under the faculty open access policies. Visitors to DASH can locate, read, and use up-to-the-minute scholarship from Harvard. DASH is crawled by search engines and indexes so a broad range of communities have the ability to discover materials in DASH. Faculty, or faculty assistants, have the ability to submit articles directly to DASH. Articles can also be emailed to OSC or faculty can request a student to help with the process.

## Breaking New Ground
OSC is undertaking many other activities related to open access, including support for open-access journal publishing, conference presentations, online distribution of PhD dissertations, and education and outreach to faculty on the importance of the policies and the procedures for supporting them.
