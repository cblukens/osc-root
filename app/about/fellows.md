Open Access Fellows are Harvard students (both undergraduate and graduate) who help faculty to make deposits into DASH.

Fellows facilitate deposits and answer questions about the Open Access Policies. Fellows also conduct bibliographic research in order to provide accurate and complete metadata descriptions of items in the repository.

## Request Help from a Fellow

If you are a Harvard faculty member or faculty assistant and would like an OA Fellow to assist you with the process of depositing work into DASH, just email us at [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}).
