Open Access Fellows are Harvard students (both undergraduate and graduate) who help faculty deposit work into DASH.

Fellows facilitate deposits, "scrape" CVs for citations, and answer questions about the Open Access Policies. They also conduct bibliographic research in order to provide accurate and complete metadata descriptions of items in the repository.

## Request Help from a Fellow

If you are a Harvard faculty member or faculty assistant and would like an OA Fellow to assist you with the process of depositing work into DASH, just email us at [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}).
