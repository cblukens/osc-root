<p>In connection with <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/oaweek2010">Open Access Week</a>, a global event for the promotion of free, immediate, online access to scholarly research, Harvard University is pleased to add its signature to the <a href="http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml" target="_blank">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://oa.mpg.de/lang/en-uk/berlin-prozess/berliner-erklarung/" target="_blank">Berlin Declaration</a> on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.</p><p>Harvard is committed to making research freely and widely available and working with other organizations to support this goal. Harvard's endorsement of these two proclamations expresses the university's support for the principles of open access, consistent with other policy actions that the university has undertaken, including enactment of open access policies in our faculties, development of open access repositories for distributing Harvard research, and support for open access journals through leadership in the Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity.</p>
