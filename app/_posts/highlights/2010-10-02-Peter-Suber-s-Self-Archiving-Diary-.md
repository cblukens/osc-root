<p>"I have a confession to make," says Earlham professor of philosophy and open access advocate, Peter Suber. "For as long as I've urged scholars to support OA, I've urged them to self-archive.  But I wasn't systematic about doing it myself until last year." Harvard's DASH repository now provides stable, long-term access to over 200 of Prof. Suber's works. You can read his entire "<a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/10-02-10.htm" target="_blank">self-archiving diary</a>" in the <em>SPARC Open Access Newsletter</em>.</p>
