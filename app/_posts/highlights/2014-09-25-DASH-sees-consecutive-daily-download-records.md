<p>On September 22nd, 2014, DASH provided a record-breaking 11,683 articles to users around the globe in one day.  On September 11th, 2014, DASH saw 11,245 articles downloaded.  A <a href="http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/4455012">1986 article</a> by Professor Gary King was downloaded thousands of times on September 22nd, helping drive the record day.  Says Professor King: "Even though my writings have long been available on my web page, DASH always manages to help new audiences find them.  That 6,000 people in one day (and 8,000 in one week) downloaded a single 27-year-old article is an amazing statement of the power of this new resource."</p>
