<p>December 1, 2010 was the first deadline to submit proposals to <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab">Harvard Library Lab</a>.  Thirty-two proposals were submitted from across the University, including Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences (including HCL), the Design School, the Kennedy School, the Law School, the Medical School, and the Radcliffe Institute.  Proposed costs ranged from $3,000 to $300,000 and while some projects might take 52 weeks, others may take only 3.  Thanks to everyone who submitted!</p>
