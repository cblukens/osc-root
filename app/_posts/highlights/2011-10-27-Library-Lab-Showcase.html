<p>Join us on Thursday, October 27 for a campus-wide exhibition of 19 projects that make original contributions to the way libraries work. All the projects were created by staff and faculty, and developed with support from the Arcadia Fund. More information <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab/showcase">here</a>.</p>
