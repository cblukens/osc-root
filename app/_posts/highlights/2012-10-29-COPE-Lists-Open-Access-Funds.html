<p>In 2009, Harvard University signed on to <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/compact">COPE</a>, the Compact for Open-access Publishing Equity, and commited to providing authors with funds to pay for publication in fee-based open-access journals. The COPE website now lists not only signatories to the compact, but also&nbsp;compliant institutions that have funds in place that are in line with the compact's language for supporting OA article processing charges. See the full list <a href="http://www.oacompact.org/signatories/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
