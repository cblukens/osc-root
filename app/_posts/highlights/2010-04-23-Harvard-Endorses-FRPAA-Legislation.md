<p>On April 23, 2010 Harvard University signed on to an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.provost.harvard.edu/reports/FRPAA_Open_Letter.pdf">open letter</a>&nbsp;endorsing the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/issues/frpaa/index.shtml" target="_blank">Federal Research Public Access Act</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:s.01373:" target="_blank">S.1373</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR05037:" target="_blank">H.R.5037</a>). Harvard was joined by 26 other institutions of higher learning, all voicing support for open, public access to federally-funded research.
