<h2 class="sr-only"> The DASH Repository: Harvard Scholarship, Global Impact </h2>

<h3 class="sr-only"> Spotlight: Access in Africa.</h3>
<p class="sr-only"> Reductions in library funding and currency fluctuation have forced African institutions of higher learning to cut back
on subscriptions to scholarly journals. In 2007, the average cost for a one-year subscription to a physics journal was almost $2,200. By 2011, it was nearly $3,500. And prices keep rising.78% of academic libraries at African institutions have less than $100,000 per year to spend on journal subscriptions.</p>

<h3 class="sr-only">African Researchers Download from DASH</h3>
<p class="sr-only">Scholars at African institutions often have limited access to subscription journals. Some have started turning to the DASH open-access repository, where thousands of journal articles by Harvard scholars are available for download, for free.</p>
<p class="sr-only">Since it launched in 2009, articles in Harvard's DASH repository have been downloaded over one million times and from nearly every country in the world. Approximately 2/3 of these downloads originated outside of the United States, and half of those (1/3 of all downloads) came from less-developed countries.</p>
