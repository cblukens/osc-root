By means of Harvard’s Open Access Policy, faculty authors in participating schools grant the university a nonexclusive, irrevocable right to distribute their scholarly articles for any non-commercial purpose. 

Scholarly articles provided to the university are stored, preserved, and made freely accessible in digital form in [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu/), Harvard University Library’s open access repository.  The repository has the institution of Harvard standing behind it to ensure its availability, longevity, and functionality.
