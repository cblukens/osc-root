The Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy and Environment of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (henceforth “Harvard-China Project”) is committed to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible. In keeping with that commitment, the Harvard-China Project adopts the following policy: Each member of the Harvard-China Project research community including faculty, staff, postdoctoral fellows, students, and visiting researchers with research appointments with the Harvard-China Project (henceforth “covered member”) grants to Harvard University permission to make available his or her scholarly articles and to exercise the copyright in those articles. More specifically, each covered member grants to Harvard University a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium, provided that the articles are not sold for a profit, and to authorize others to do the same. The policy applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored while the person is a covered member of the Harvard-China Project, except for any articles completed before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the covered member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. The Provost or Provost’s designate will waive application of the license for a particular article or delay access for a specified period of time upon express direction by a covered member.

Each covered member will provide an electronic copy of the author’s final version of each article at the time of acceptance for publication at no charge to the appropriate representative of the Provost’s Office in an appropriate format (such as PDF) specified by the Provost’s Office. Distribution of peer-reviewed articles scheduled for publication will be postponed until the date of publication.  

The Provost’s Office may make the article available to the public in an open-access repository. The Office of the Provost in consultation with the Executive Director of the Harvard-China Project will be responsible for interpreting this policy, resolving disputes concerning its interpretation and application, and recommending changes to the covered members from time to time.
