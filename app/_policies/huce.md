Harvard has pioneered measures to promote open access and move toward a publishing system that is in keeping with the University's goals of disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible. One of these measures is an open-access policy that has the effect of allowing open distribution of research articles.

HUCE is committed to advancing these university-wide goals, and its research community, including its postdoctoral Environmental Fellows, will provide an electronic copy of the author's final version of each scholarly article to the appropriate representative of the Provost's Office, to be deposited into the open Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard (DASH) repository.

HUCE Environmental Fellows grant the President and Fellows of Harvard College permission to make available his or her scholarly articles and to exercise the copyright in those articles. More specifically, each Environmental Fellow grants to the President and Fellows of Harvard College a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium, provided that the articles are not sold for a profit, and to authorize others to do the same. The policy applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored while the person is a member of HUCE except for any articles completed before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. The Provost or Provost's designate will waive application of the license for a particular article or delay access for a specified period of time upon express direction by a Fellow.
