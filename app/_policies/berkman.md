The Berkman Center for Internet & Society is committed to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible. In keeping with that commitment, the faculty directors and staff including employee fellows (henceforth "covered members") adopt the following policy: Each covered member grants to Harvard University permission to make available his or her scholarly articles whose subject relates to the purview of research at the Berkman Center, and to exercise the copyright in those articles. More specifically, each covered member grants to Harvard University a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium, provided that the articles are not sold for a profit, and to authorize others to do the same. The policy applies to all scholarly articles authored or co-authored while the person is a covered member except for any articles completed before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the covered member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. The Provost or Provost's designate will waive application of the license for a particular article or delay access for a specified period of time upon express direction by a covered member author.

Each covered member will provide an electronic copy of the author's final version of each article no later than the date of its publication at no charge to the appropriate representative of the Provost's Office in an appropriate format (such as PDF) specified by the Provost's Office.

The Provost's Office may make the article available to the public in an open-access repository. The Office of the Provost will be responsible for interpreting this policy, resolving disputes concerning its interpretation and application, and recommending changes to the Center from time to time. The policy will be reviewed by the Berkman Center for Internet & Society after three years and a report presented to the faculty directors.
