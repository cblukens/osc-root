q: What if the digital image is a digital copy of an analog photograph of a three-dimensional public domain work (such as a sculpture)? Would the Policy apply?
order: 15
anchor: three-dimensional
type: basic

Probably not. In most cases, the analog photograph itself would have enough creativity to warrant its own copyright. Hence, unless the copyright in the photograph had expired, the secondary representation of the underlying work would not be in the public domain, and the Policy would not apply.
