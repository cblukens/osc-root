No. Harvard University Herbaria will neither grant nor deny permission to use digital content covered by the Policy. Tell your publisher that it is not necessary to ask for permission to use public domain works. Provide it with a copy of Harvard's Policy if it still has concerns.

Other parts of this FAQ give guidance on when digital content on a Harvard University Herbaria website is covered by the Policy.
