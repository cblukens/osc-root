Under the Policy, Harvard University Herbaria waives any copyright it may have in digital reproductions of works in its collections, when the underlying works are in the public domain and when the digital reproductions are made openly available on Harvard University Herbaria websites. These digital reproductions may be used by anyone for any purpose without first securing copyright permission from the Harvard University Herbaria or any other representative of Harvard University.
For the Policy itself, which includes further explanation and certain exclusions, see theÂ [Harvard University Herbaria Policy on Access to Digital Reproductions of Works in the Public Domain]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/open-initiatives/huh-pd/).
