q: Our standard publication agreement is inconsistent with the Harvard policies. Does this mean that we can no longer publish papers by Harvard authors?

No. Harvard’s prior non-exclusive license takes precedence but allows the author to transfer non-exclusive publication and other rights. Harvard authors may use an addendum specifically designed to make publication agreements consistent with the applicable policy.

A sample copy of the addendum is available, which includes the basic addendum and some optional paragraphs that authors may add but that are not required for consistency with the policy. However, regardless of whether an addendum is used, unless the author directs that a waiver be granted of Harvard’s rights for a particular work completed after the policy went into effect, Harvard’s license stands.''
