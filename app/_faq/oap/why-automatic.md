First, experience has shown that mere exhortations have little effect on authorsâ€™ behavior. For instance, before Congress made it a requirement, participation in the NIH Public Access Policy was optional. During that period, there was only a 4% level of compliance.

Second, experience in many areas has shown that opt-out systems achieve much higher degrees of participation than opt-in systems, even while remaining noncoercive.

Third, by making a blanket policy, individual faculty benefit from their membership in the policy-making group. The University can work with publishers on behalf of the faculty to simplify procedures and broaden access. Without a blanket policy, the unified action benefit of the policy would be vitiated.
