Harvard University has long had a policy that "when entering into agreements for the publication and distribution of copyrighted materials individuals will make arrangements that best serve the public interest." In the eyes of many, including the Provost's Committee on Scholarly Publishing and large numbers of individual faculty members, this goal is best served by using the unified action of the faculty to enable individual faculty to distribute their scholarly writings freely.

Other organizations with a vested interest in scholarship are independently supporting such efforts as well. For instance, the [Wellcome Trust](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) requires any scholarly articles on research they fund to be made openly accessible. The [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nih.gov/), by congressional legislation, have instituted a similar requirement, mandating posting in the open-access PubMed Central repository.
