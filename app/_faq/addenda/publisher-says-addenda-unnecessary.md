It may still be a good idea to use the addendum. The nonexclusive license to Harvard enables the University to allow you and others to make various beneficial uses of the article, so long as the article is not sold for a profit, such as allowing you to include copies of the article in a course pack or to make derivative works of the article, which may be in conflict with provisions of the publication agreement.

To avoid a conflicting transfer of copyright to the publisher and to protect yourself from breach of contract, you may still want to attach an addendum. However, if the publisher's agreement is wholly consistent with Harvard's license, you would not need to use the addendum. This may be the case, for example, for some open-access journals.
