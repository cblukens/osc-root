You have a number of options. One is to obtain a [waiver](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/authors/waiver/generate) of the license under the policy. Alternatively, you can work to persuade the publisher that it should accept Harvard's non-exclusive license in order to be able to publish your article, or seek a different publisher. You can consult with the Office for Scholarly Communication for help in the process of working with publishers and addressing their specific concerns.
