Complete an appropriate form of addendum, sign and date the form, add a statement to the publisher's agreement making it subject to the addendum, and attach the addendum to the publisher's agreement. An [addendum generator](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/authors/addendum/generate) with instructions is provided [here](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/authors/addendum/generatew).
