Under the Policy, Harvard Library waives any copyright it may have in digital reproductions of works in its collections, when the underlying works are in the public domain and when the digital reproductions are made openly available on Harvard Library websites. These digital reproductions may be used by anyone for any purpose without first securing copyright permission from the Harvard Library or any other representative of Harvard University.

For the Policy itself, which includes further explanation and certain exclusions, see the [Harvard Library Policy on Access to Digital Reproductions of Works in the Public Domain]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/open-initiatives/hl-pd/).
