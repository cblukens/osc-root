Often high-resolution images are available. Some may be available for download from the website itself. While Harvard does not charge for use of digital images it makes openly available, whether they are high- or low-resolution, the policy notes that "[t]here may be costs associated with fulfilling requests for new digitization or for the provision of digital files that are not openly available." Check with the appropriate library for more information.
