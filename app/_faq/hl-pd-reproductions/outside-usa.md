When the underlying work is in the public domain in the United States and the other conditions of the policy are met, Harvard Library waives any copyright it may have in the digital reproduction, regardless of where it is used. Note, however, that the underlying work may still be protected by copyright in a different country. You may still need to get permission from the copyright owner in order to use the digital reproduction. (This is true whether the holder of foreign copyright in the underlying work is a third party or Harvard.) You are solely responsible for making that determination and securing all necessary permissions.
