The Policy does not apply to digital reproductions of works that are protected by copyright. It also does not apply to secondary representations (whether analog or digital) of public domain works when the secondary representation is sufficiently original to be protected by copyright under U.S. law. For example, the Policy does not apply to a digital reproduction of an in-copyright analog photograph of a public domain sculpture, or a modern digital photograph of such a sculpture. (Harvard Library accepts the conclusion reached in _Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel, 36 F. Supp. 2d 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1999)_, that a "slavish copy" of a two-dimensional work lacks sufficient originality for copyright protection under U.S. law.) Nor does the Policy apply to digital content that is not openly available on a Harvard Library web site. See below for further explanations.
