You should first see whether the digital reproduction is openly available (within the meaning of the policy) on a Harvard Library website.

Next, determine whether the underlying work is in the public domain in the United States. In some cases, there may be an indication in the record for the item indicating its public domain status. In other cases, you will have to make that determination on your own. Some resources to help you are provided at the end of this document.

Lastly, check if the digital reproduction – and any intermediate representation (such as a photograph) – is merely a slavish copy of the original work, rather than being an original creative work in its own right.

If all conditions are met (i.e., the reproduction is openly available from a Harvard Library website; the underlying work is in the public domain in the U.S.; and the digital reproduction and any intermediate representation are merely "slavish copies"), then the policy applies.

Note that while the Harvard Library may waive any copyright it may have in certain digital reproductions of public domain works and may provide information about its understanding of copyright status, you are solely responsible for making independent legal assessments of an item's status in the arena in which it is to be used. The Library makes no express or implied warranty as to the public domain status of items found in its collections, or as to the accuracy of any information it may provide about copyright or public domain status.
