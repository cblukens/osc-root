No. Some of the digital reproductions found on a site do not reproduce works in the public domain. Some of the digital reproductions found on a site may have been provided by another library and are not part of the Harvard Library collection. Agreements with commercial partners for the digitization of Harvard collections may prevent public domain content from being openly available on a Harvard Library website.

The Policy only applies to digital reproductions of works in its collections, when the underlying works are in the public domain in the U.S. and when the digital reproductions are made “openly available” on Harvard Library websites. For purposes of the Policy, content is not “openly available” if the Harvard Library website requires a user to log-in, authenticate, pay money, or agree to license terms, or if the content otherwise is subject to or accompanied by restrictions on access or use.
