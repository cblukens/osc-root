To request a waiver, simply use the Waiver Generator and supply the information requested there. A formal letter notifying you of the waiver of the policy will be sent back to you at the address you provide.

Even if you are required by a publisher to waive the Open Access Policy as a condition of publication, chances are you can still make your article publicly available in the Harvard repository, as explained further below. Thus, whether your article is under a waiver or not, you should still deposit the final manuscript in DASH.

Although you may waive the application of the Open Access Policy to your article, if your peer-reviewed article is subject to the NIH Public Access Policy because it arose, in whole or in part, from NIH-funded research and was accepted for publication on or after April 7, 2008, your obligations under the NIH policy cannot be waived.
