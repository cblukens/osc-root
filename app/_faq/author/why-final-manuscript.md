In most cases, license agreements grant you more extensive rights to distribute the [author's final version]({{site.baseurl}}/authors/faq/#final-manuscript) than they do to the published version.

Much of your work---anything authored before the date an Open Access Policy was passed in your school, for example---does not fall under the Open Access Policy.

In these cases, your right to distribute your work to others (including online) is limited by whatever agreement you reached with the publisher.

Thus, even when you are not allowed to distribute the published version, you may be able to make your final manuscript available for download in DASH without violating the license agreement. Let us [investigate this for you](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=Request%20for%20assistance%20with%20DASH) and we'll make a recommendation.
