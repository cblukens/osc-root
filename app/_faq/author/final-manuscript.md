A final manuscript is the last document that you send the publisher, after the completion of the peer review process.

Even though this document might be almost identical to the published version of the paper, your manuscript is typically treated differently than the published version for purposes of licensing and copyright.

A final manuscript is sometimes referred to as a “post-print.”  It shouldn’t be confused, however, with a “page proof.”  Unlike a manuscript, the page proof is a document produced by a publisher for your review just prior to publication.
