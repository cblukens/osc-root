The "author's final version" of a work is the last document that you send to the publisher, after the completion of the peer review process.

Even though this document---sometimes called a "final manuscript"---might be almost identical to the published version of the paper, your final manuscript is typically treated differently than the published version for purposes of licensing and author rights.

A final manuscript is not the same as a "page proof." You provide the publisher with your final manuscript. The publisher then provides you with a page proof for review just prior to publication.

It is likely that you have the right to freely and openly distribute many of your final manuscripts in DASH, making it easier for your colleagues to find, access, and cite your scholarly work.
