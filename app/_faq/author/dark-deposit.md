A dark deposit is a work in DASH whose full text is “dark” (not OA), even when information about the work (citation, abstract, etc.) is OA.

We try to avoid or minimize dark deposits. That is, we try to make all DASH deposits OA. But we make deposits dark in two circumstances:

1.  When the author has requested an embargo, and
2.  When we don’t have rights to provide OA to the version(s) available to us.

In the first case, we will make the work OA when the embargo expires.

In the second case, we might lack the relevant rights because the author has obtained a waiver, or the work was published before the author granted non-exclusive rights to Harvard through the OA policy at his/her school, or our rights only apply to a certain version and we don’t yet have a copy of that version. Regardless of the cause, we will make a version of the work OA if or when we obtain the rights to do so.

In general, when a work is subject to a Harvard OA policy, we have non-exclusive rights to provide OA to the accepted author manuscript (AAM), and not the version of record (VOR). If the author submits the VOR to DASH, either we hold it or make it dark until we can obtain the AAM or until we obtain permission to distribute the VOR.
