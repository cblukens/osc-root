Yes, the license allows Harvard to permit you and others to make derivative works based on articles that fall under the open access policy. However, Harvard would only exercise this right in order to advance the aims of the policy.

Harvard recognizes authors' interest in the integrity of their
scholarly articles.  It is difficult to foresee the many derivative works that may occur in the future: Harvard may use derivative work rights to include articles in a collection or database, to change document formats, to prepare abridgments, or to create other derivative works that we cannot currently foresee.  Despite these many possibilities, Harvard will not allow derivative works that misrepresent the substance of an article.

Furthermore, if Harvard allows the display or distribution of any derivative work that modifies the substance of the original document (e.g., an abridgment), it will require that the derivative work include a citation, hyperlink or similar reference to the original document and that it appropriately identify the nature of the revision (e.g., "abridged from ____").

As technology and modes of distributing and using scholarly content evolve, it may serve the open access goal for Harvard to adjust the derivative work rights granted to the public.  In any such decisions, the Office for Scholarly Communication will be guided by its faculty committee, which will consider not only the aims of the open access
policy but also the interests of faculty authors.
