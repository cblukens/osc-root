For Harvard employees, such as faculty members or paid researchers, the payment or reimbursement of open-access publication fees may reasonably be viewed as a "working condition fringe" (defined in [Internal Revenue Code Section 132](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/132) as any property or service provided by an employer to an employee to the extent that, if the employee paid for the property or service, the payment would represent a deductible employee business expense). Since working condition fringe benefits are excludable from income, amounts reimbursed to employees from the HOPE Fund would not be includible in income on the employee's Form W-2, and would not be subject to any reporting or withholding.

For non-employee students, the payment or reimbursement of the fees would not be deemed a "working condition fringe", but rather, scholarship or fellowship payments, which are subject to tax under Code [Section 117](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/117) unless used for qualified tuition and related expenses.

Reimbursements thus may be taxable. For U.S. persons, there is no requirement for Harvard to withhold on, or report the amount of, such fellowship payments. Any required reporting is done by the recipients on their individual returns. For non-U.S. persons, taxable amounts are subject to reporting on a Form 1042-S, and are subject to withholding, subject to any income tax treaties with the recipient's country of residence, in the same manner as any other fellowship payment to such individuals provided by the university.
