Reimbursable article-processing fees may include publication fees (charges levied on articles accepted for publication, including page charges), and submission fees (charges levied on articles submitted for publication). Eligible fees must be based on a publication's standard fee schedule that is independent of the author's institution.

In the case of foreign transactions, HOPE Fund reimbursements will take into account the exchange rate of an author's bank, and cover that cost on his or her behalf. However, HOPE will not reimburse additional bank fees or fees related to the transfer of payment or currency conversion. For instance, HOPE will not reimburse wire-transfer fees.
