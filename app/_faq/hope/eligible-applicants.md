Funds are available to any Harvard employees and students (including faculty, researchers, administrators, librarians, staff, postdocs, and fellows) for articles resulting from their research activities.

Faculty and others who are covered by one of the Harvard [open-access policies](/policies/) must be in substantial compliance with the relevant open-access policy. ([All Harvard schools and some research centers](/policies/) now have open-access policies.) For more detail, see [what compliance means for this purpose](#oa-compliance).

Funds for affiliates of Harvard Medical School are limited to quad-based researchers.
