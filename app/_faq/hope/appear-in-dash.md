Yes. The article will be deposited in [DASH](https://dash.harvard.edu) on your behalf. This will happen after the [reimbursement process](#when-reimbursement-begins) has begun for an eligible author, and after the Office for Scholarly Communication acquires an [appropriate version](/authors/faq/#what-version) of the article for DASH distribution.
