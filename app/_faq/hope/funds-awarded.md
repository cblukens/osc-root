Yes, we provide open access to [Harvard's HOPE fund data](https://treemaps.intact-project.org/apcdata/harvard-u/), from 2010 to the present, through the [Open APC project](https://treemaps.intact-project.org/), an initiative providing open data on fees paid for open-access journal articles by universities and research institutions.

Note that this information is limited to APCs paid by the HOPE fund, and does not cover APCs paid from other sources for articles by Harvard authors. For example, some APCs are paid by grants or funding agencies.

We also maintain a list of [HOPE-funded articles and award recipients](/programs/hope/awards/).
