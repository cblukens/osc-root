The venue of publication must be an established open-access journal, that is, a journal that does not charge readers or their institutions for unfettered access to the peer-reviewed articles that it publishes.

Journals with a hybrid open-access model or delayed open-access model are not eligible. To be eligible, a journal must meet these additional requirements:

- Be listed in the Directory of [Open Access Journals](http://www.doaj.org/) (unless the journal is too new for DOAJ eligibility),
- Be a member of the [Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association](http://oaspa.org/) or adhere to its [Code of Conduct](http://www.oaspa.org/conduct.php),
- Have publicly available a standard article fee schedule, 
- Have a policy to substantially waive fees in case of economic hardship.
Currently, all of the major open-access publishers satisfy these conditions.

We trust requesters to make appropriate decisions about the quality of the publication venue and the value of its services in relation to the fees it charges. As we gain experience with administering the fund, we may institute further procedures for vetting venues.
