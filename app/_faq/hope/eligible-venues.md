The venue of publication must be an established open-access journal, that is, a journal that does not charge readers or their institutions for unfettered access to the peer-reviewed articles it publishes.

Journals with a hybrid open-access model or delayed open-access model are not eligible. To be eligible, a journal must meet these additional requirements:

- The journal must be listed in the [Directory of Open Access Journals](http://www.doaj.org/) (DOAJ), unless the journal is too new for DOAJ eligibility.
- The publisher must be a member of the [Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association](http://oaspa.org/) or adhere to its [Code of Conduct](https://oaspa.org/membership/code-of-conduct/).
- The journal must make articles open access under a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/licensing-examples/).
- The journal must have a publicly available article-fee schedule.
- The journal must have a policy to waive or substantially discount fees in case of economic hardship.

We trust requesters to make appropriate decisions about the quality of the publication venue and the value of its services in relation to the fees it charges. As we gain experience with administering the fund, we may institute further procedures for vetting journals.
