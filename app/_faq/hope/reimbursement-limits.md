There is a nominal limit on the total reimbursement per article of $3,000, though there are no known eligible journals with fees that reach the cap. The average publication fee for fee-based open-access journals is approximately one-third of the cap.

There is no limit on the number of articles reimbursed, except that authors may receive reimbursement for up to a total of $3,000 per fiscal year for all article processing fees. Reimbursement can cover 100% of fees up to the cap. Unused amounts do not roll over to future years. Exceptions to the $3,000 cap may be made based on availability of funds.

We expect, based on the experience of similar funds, that the total outlay of funds in the near term will be minimal, and do not expect to have to limit disbursements further. However, should demand for funds exceed expectations, we may limit access to funds on a first-come-first-served basis. As we gain experience with the process, the method for calculating reimbursement and limitations thereon may be changed over time.
