HOPE will pay up to $3,000 per Harvard author per fiscal year.

Apart from this cap, reimbursements can cover 100% of fees, and there is no limit on the number of fees reimbursed. Unused amounts do not roll over to future years. Exceptions to the $3,000 cap may be made based on availability of funds.

So far the fund has been large enough to cover all eligible requests. However, if that changes, we may limit access to funds on a first-come, first-served basis.
