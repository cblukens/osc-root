Articles for which alternative funding is available are not eligible for reimbursement. This includes articles reporting research funded by a gift or a grant from a granting agency, foundation, or other institution (including Harvard itself) that allows granted funds to be used for article processing fees (whether or not the particular grant had budgeted for such fees and whether or not sufficient grant funds remain), and articles funded by an institution that itself pays article processing fees on behalf of the author (such as [Wellcome Trust](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Open-access/index.htm)).
