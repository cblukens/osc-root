- Your works will be open access in DASH and available for anyone around the world to read and download.

- For most authors, you will have more works open access in DASH than are covered by the Harvard open-access policies.

- For works not covered by the Harvard open-access license, you will be spared the work of seeking permission to share them. For all works, you will be spared the work of depositing them in the repository.

- Works in DASH are indexed in a very wide range of search engines (including Google and Google Scholar). They are easy to discover, and they are downloaded by the millions of every year. DASH will let you see how many times any individual work has been downloaded and from where. Each of your works in DASH will receive a permanent URL and be preserved in the Harvard Libraryâ€™s state-of-the-art digital preservation system.
