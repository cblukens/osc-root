To request a CV Scrape or ask any questions, please contact the OSC. We will then confirm your request and start the process. 

Please note that before we can begin the CV Scrape, you will need to sign an Assistance Authorization (AA). AAs do two things: reaffirm the <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/">open-access policy</a> (if you are covered by one) and give the OSC permission to make DASH-related licensing choices on your behalf. The latter ensures copyright compliance in DASH and allows us to request a publisherâ€™s permission to distribute a work in DASH.
