To request a CV Scrape or ask any questions, please <a href="mailto:osc@harvard.edu">contact the OSC</a>. We will then confirm your request and start the process. 

Please note that before we can begin the CV Scrape, you will need to sign an <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/dash/proxy/webform">Assistance Authorization</a> (AA). AAs do two things: reaffirm the <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/">open-access policy</a> (if you are covered by one) and give the OSC permission to make DASH-related licensing choices on your behalf. The latter ensures copyright compliance in DASH and allows us to request a publisherâ€™s permission to distribute a work in DASH.
