The Office for Scholarly Communication has created an email list to announce news on open access, scholarly communication, and other topics relevant to our work.

This will be a low-traffic, announcement-only list limited to events, news, and other developments at Harvard. However, we welcome subscribers from beyond Harvard.

Only the OSC can post messages to the list. But if you have a relevant announcement you'd like us to distribute, please send it to [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}).
