The Office for Scholarly Communication spearheads campus-wide initiatives to open, share, and preserve scholarship. With support from OSC, [open-access policies]({{site.baseurl}}/policies/) are now in place at all Harvard schools.  Harvard research centers have also begun to adopt open-access policies, including the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, and the Harvard University Center for the Environment.

The OSC also runs supporting programs such as:

- [DASH](http://dash.harvard.edu/), the University’s central, open-access repository,
- the [HOPE fund]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/hope/), to reimburse processing fees for articles published in open-access journals,
- [COPE](http://www.oacompact.org/), a multi-university compact to underwrite publication charges for open-access journals,
- [ETDs @ Harvard](http://etds.lib.harvard.edu/about.html), the University’s electronic theses and dissertation submission system. It is managed by each participating school and maintained by the OSC,
- Harvard's [Copyright Advisory Program](http://copyright.lib.harvard.edu/), including the [Copyright First Responders]({{site.baseurl}}/programs/copyright/first-responders/).

Past OSC projects include:

- [Library Lab]({{site.baseurl}}/liblab/), offering opportunities for individuals to make original contributions to the way libraries work.
